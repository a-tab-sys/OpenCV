Very few things can beat a deep learning model


OpenCV is often used for preprocessing data (performing image normalization, mean subtraction, etc...)


We will use a deep learning model to classify between the simpson characters. We will use OpenCV to read in an image a resize it to a particular size before feeding it to our network.
